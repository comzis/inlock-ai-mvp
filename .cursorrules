# Inlock AI - Cursor Rules
# These rules enforce safe deployment and development practices.

## Critical Deployment Rules
1. **Source of Truth**: 
   - ALWAYS work in `/home/comzis/projects/inlock-ai-mvp`
   - NEVER modify files in `/opt/inlock-ai-secure-mvp` directly
   - App source code resides in `apps/inlock-ai`

2. **Production Stack**:
   - The production service is `inlock-ai` defined in `compose/services/stack.yml`
   - NEVER deploy using `compose/services/inlock-ai.yml` standalone (missing deps)
   - To restart production: `docker compose -p services -f compose/services/stack.yml up -d --force-recreate inlock-ai`

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Verify infrastructure changes with `scripts/preflight.sh`
   - Check `docs/ANTIGRAVITY-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` for full protocol

## Development Context
- This is a Next.js application (apps/inlock-ai)
- Uses Docker for deployment
- Enforces strict localization (EN, FR, SR)
- Follows Apple Developer typography guidelines (no excessive bolding)
