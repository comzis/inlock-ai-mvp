# Antigravity Coordination

## Tool Responsibilities

| Tool | Purpose | Changes |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Cursor** | Infrastructure, ops, deployment | Docker Compose, Traefik, certs, services |
| **Antigravity** | Feature development, testing | Application code, frontend, features |

## Before Infrastructure Changes

1. Check recent app commits: `git log --oneline -10`
2. Check active branches: `git branch -a`
3. If Antigravity is working on related features, coordinate timing
4. Document changes that affect the development workflow

## Protected Files (coordinate with Antigravity)

- `compose/services/inlock-ai.yml` — application service config
- `compose/services/inlock-db.yml` — database config
- `apps/inlock-ai/` — application source code (Antigravity's domain)

## After Infrastructure Changes

- Update relevant docs
- Commit with clear messages
- Ensure Antigravity's changes won't conflict with infrastructure
