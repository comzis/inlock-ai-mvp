# CPU / load alert check (emails when host load sustained above threshold)
# Runs every 5 minutes. Uses alert.sh; email requires mail/sendmail (e.g. msmtp-mta).
# Default: only alerts when 5m average is also high (reduces noise from brief spikes).
# To require 15m sustained: CPU_LOAD_PERSISTENCE=15m in env or in this file.
# MAILTO sends cron errors to this address instead of root (avoids mail loop on mail.inlock.ai)
MAILTO=milorad.stevanovic@inlock.ai
